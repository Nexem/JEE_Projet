JEE_Project V2 :

You can find the second version of the project on the following git link : https://github.com/Nexem/Jee_Projet_V2
On this version, we have tried to implement the JPA and the MySQL database but we've encountered difficulties and we commented all of these parts.
We also implemented some JSTL in the JSP files to avoid using Java, but we havn't been able to do so in the details.jsp
